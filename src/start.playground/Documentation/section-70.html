    	<p class="para">Add a <code class="code-voice">color</code> method to <code class="code-voice">Suit</code> that returns “black” for spades and clubs, and returns “red” for hearts and diamonds.

  Notice the two ways that the <code class="code-voice">Hearts</code> member of the enumeration is referred to above: When assigning a value to the <code class="code-voice">hearts</code> constant, the enumeration member <code class="code-voice">Suit.Hearts</code> is referred to by its full name because the constant doesn’t have an explicit type specified. Inside the switch, the enumeration is referred to by the abbreviated form <code class="code-voice">.Hearts</code> because the value of <code class="code-voice">self</code> is already known to be a suit. You can use the abbreviated form anytime the value’s type is already known.
</p><p class="para">
  Use <code class="code-voice">struct</code> to create a structure. Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they are passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.
